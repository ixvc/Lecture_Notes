 Using stack to write add program in arm assembly.

PUSH {LR}

;;mov the value to the registers
;; Push all those registers
Push{R2,R3,R4,R5}
;;The lowest register will always go to the lower-address and the higher register will subsequently go to the
;;higher address.

;;if you do this 
push{R5-R2} ;;This will give me an error, since the first parameter needs to be lowest reister and secodn needs to be higher one
;;If you do this now
push{R2-R5}
